TODO for future releases
------------------------

- Add support for permanently deleting files after they have been safely moved to the trash and reviewed.
- Provide more fine‑grained file type filters (e.g. separate video formats, documents, etc.).
- Support scanning and cleaning multiple folders at once.
- Add a progress bar when scanning very large folders.
- Improve duplicate detection with content hashing in parallel to speed up safe mode.
